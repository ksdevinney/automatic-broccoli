# Quiz

## Description

![quiz preview](/assets/images/quiz-preview.png)

This is a quiz application created in JavaScript. When the user clicks that Start button, questions about JavaScript will appear on the page. When the first question loads, a timer starts counting down from 60. The user will try to answer all the questions before time runs out. However, if a question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer.

When the user has answered all questions, or when the timer runs out, an alert will show the user their score (number of questions answered correctly). Then, the user will be prompted to input their name. Once a name has been entered, the name and score can be viewed on the "High Scores" page. If no name is inputted, the name will register as "null".

## Motivation

The goal of creating this project was to learn more about how JavaScript and HTML interact on a webpage. The timer and questions were implemented using JavaScript, which references HTML elements on the page.

High scores and names inputted by the user are stored in the browser's local storage

## How to Access

The application is deployed on GitHub pages, found [here](https://ksdevinney.github.io/automatic-broccoli/).
